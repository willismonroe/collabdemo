GitHub is very forgiving; the whole magic of using git to store and track changes in many versions of text (e.g. code) over time is that you can always roll things back to how they were. The system for reviewing and merging writing described in this lesson makes it so folks not comfortable with GitHub can't delete other folks' work or break the website. And even if you could, using git versioning means we can easily roll back any changes you make to how the site previously looked/functioned.
